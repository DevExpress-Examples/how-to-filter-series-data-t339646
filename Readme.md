# How to filter series data 

This example shows how to create a chart, bind it to a data source and filter series data.

To do this, follow these steps:

* Create a chart and add a series. For more information, refer to the following topic: [How to Create Series](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/6339/controls-and-libraries/charts-suite/chart-control/chart-elements/series#how-to-create-series)

* Bind the series to data. See the following topic: [Populate a series with data from a data source](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/6339/controls-and-libraries/charts-suite/chart-control/chart-elements/series#populate-a-series-with-data-from-a-data-source)

* Specify the [Series.FilterString](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Charts.Series.FilterString?p=netframework) property to filter series data.
